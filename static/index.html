            <h1>Place: IPv6v2</h1>
            <p>This is a fun experiment and continuation of ziad87's sillyness.</p>
            <p>Each pixel or 2x2 group is controlled by pinging this IPv6 Prefix
                and specifying how to place the pixel by changing the last 4 segments.
            </p>
